    @author: Joel
    UCC-style ansatz that doesn't preserve anything (i.e. uses all basis
    states). This is basically an implementation of create_arbitrary_state
    (however, theta will not match the coefficients in the superposition)
    built on pyquil.paulis.exponentiate_map.

    One idea is to use lowering and raising operators and "check operators"
    instead of Xs. This results in a more straight-forward mapping of theta
    to the coefficients since no previously produced state will be mapped
    to other states in a later stage. To clarify: with the current
    implementation the state |1 1 0> will both be produced by exp(X2 X1)
    operating on |0 0 0> and by exp(X2) operating on exp(X1)|0 0 0> (which
    contains a |0 1 0> term). This could improve potential bad properties
    with the current implementation. However, it might be difficult to
    create commuting hermitian terms, which is required in
    exponential_map_commuting_pauli_terms.

    If this function is called multiple times, particularly if theta has the
    same length in all calls, caching terms might significantly increase
    performance.
